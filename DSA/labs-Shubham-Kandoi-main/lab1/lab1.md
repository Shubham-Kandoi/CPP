# Reflection for Lab 1

# 1. What did you like/not like about Python
#
## Ans:  While working with Python in this lab, I really liked how easy the syntax was. I didn’t need to use semicolons or declare variable types, which made the code look cleaner and faster to write. What I didn’t like at first was how strict Python is with indentation. If the spacing is not correct, it gives an error, which was confusing for me in the beginning. But after some practice, I started to understand it better and saw how it helps keep the code neat.

# 2. Was there anything that behaved differently than you expected in Python?
#
## Ans: Yes, one thing that behaved differently was how Python handles variables. I didn’t have to declare the type like in C++, which felt strange at first but later made things easier. Also, I was surprised that Python uses indentation instead of curly braces for blocks of code. It was different from what I expected, but I got used to it quickly.

# 3. Based on what you wrote in your lab, write something about the similarities and differences between Python with C/C++ and how that affects how you write your program.
#
## Ans: Python and C++ both let me write functions, use loops, and create classes, but the way they do it is very different. Python is simpler and needs fewer lines of code, while C++ needs more setup like including libraries and using semicolons. In python I do not need to worry about variable types,  which makes writing code easier. Whereas, in C/C++ declare variable types when i am declaring the variable. Python feels easier for quick solutions, while C++ needs more careful structure.
