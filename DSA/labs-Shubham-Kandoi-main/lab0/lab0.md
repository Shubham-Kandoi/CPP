## LaTex Formulas

Put your formulas here

## 1. hypotenus of a right angle triangle:

$$c = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$$

## 2. geometric series: sum from i=0 to n (ar^i)

$$\sum_{i=0}^{n} ar^i$$


## 3. arithmetic series closed form: sum from i = 1 to n (i) = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4...n=(n)(n+1)/2

$$\sum_{i=1}^{n} i = 1 + 2 + 3 + \ldots + n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}$$

### What aspect of the lab did you find to be the hardest?

The LaTeX formulas were the trickiest part of the lab for me. They were not very hard, but I needed some time to learn the right way to write them. I also had to check the file on GitHub to see if the formulas looked correct. I tried a few times before getting it right. After I understood the format, it became easier, but it still took more effort than the other tasks.

### What do you think about CodeSpaces? What did you like/not like about Codespaces?

I think Codespaces is a very helpful tool. I liked that I didn’t have to install anything on my computer and I could write and run code directly in the browser. It was fast and easy to use. The only thing I didn’t like is that sometimes it takes time to load, and if you forget to push your code, it can be lost. But overall, it’s a great tool for doing labs and assignments.
